As it is demonstrated on the figure below, the dataset is separated in subsets by years. The training dataset starts with the first year(2000) and grows each each step by one new year. The model is trained on the training dataset and tested on subsequent years of match data. The model score is assessed. This happens until the training dataset covers the years 2000-2020. The score of the model is the average score. "
